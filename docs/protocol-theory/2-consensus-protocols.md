At their core, blockchains exist due to consensus protocols developed based on the concepts of distributed system design. Consensus protocols determine how transactions are validated, how governance is maintained, and how attacks are mitigated.

The original Bitcoin and Ethereum whitepapers are great case studies of early blockchain consensus protocols, both using a Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism.
